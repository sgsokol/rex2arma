Title: Convertion of a (relativly simple) R code to RcppArmadillo code
Version: 0.4

Description: rex2arma is aimed to automatise the converion of R code doing
    heavy matrix/vector manipulations into RcppArmadillo code. Some limitations
    on a code that can be converted apply, e.g. no type changing in the
    function body, no global assignements and so on. Several types of variables
    are supported (logical, integer, numeric, complex, character) as well as
    data structures (scalars, vectors, matrices, lists). For code control, user
    can use 'if/else' (also as ternary operator), 'for' loop.
