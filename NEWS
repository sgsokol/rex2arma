Version 0.6
===============

* 2017-07-24
 new features in this release:
  - recursive functions are now admitted (e.g. fib=function(n) if (n<2) n else fib(n-1)+fib(n-2))
  - functions defined in functions are now admitted;
  - exec parameter is made integer and '-1' was added to list of possible values;
  - recursive use of rex2arma() is now possible (used for locally defined functions);
  - added some basic unit tests;
 fixed bugs most notable of which are:
  - comparison expressions in indexing are now correctly translated with ".find()";
  - a scalar can be assigned to a (sub)vector (".fill()" is used);
  - probability distributions function work now with vector and scalar arguments (both as input and returned values);
 acceptance tests passed:
  - expm.higham (test/test_expm.R)
  - scaleTau2 (test/test4rex2arma.R)
